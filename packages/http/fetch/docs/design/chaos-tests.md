## Using the Chaos Handler to Simulate Graph API Errors

The chaos handler is designed to simulate random API Errors that may be generated by the server when accessing your API.

### How to use

You will need to add `ChaosHandler` as middleware to your tests as demonstrated below so as to randomly intercept and generate error responses in your tests.

This class is not added by default to any of the options

### Chaos Config Options

|  Option | Type  | Required | Default | Definitions  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  chaosStrategy | Enum (MANUAL/RANDOM)  | No  | RANDOM  | Can generate random errors with random status codes or respond with user provided status codes |
|  statusCode | Number  | No  | *random*  | Response status code to be retured |
|  baseUrl | String  | No  | *undefined*  | *Specify the base url to provided response options using a relative path |
|  chaosPercentage | Number (0 - 100)  | No  | 10  | Error percentage to be introduced in the service |
|  responseBody | String (Json)  | No  | *empty body  | Users can specify the specific response body to be returned when an error occurs |
|  headers | Record<string,string>  | No  | *empty  | Specify headers required to generate the errors |

### NB: Error behavior

Fetch has a default retry handler as middleware that automatically reattempts to resolve failed requests and provides a robust experience. This middleware will work to counter the chaos handler for supported requests.
