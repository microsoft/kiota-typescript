The Kiota abstractions Library is the javascript library defining the basic constructs the Kiota projects need once an SDK has been generated from an OpenAPI definition.

A Kiota generated project will need a reference to the abstraction package to build and run.

Read more about Kiota here.

## Using the abstractions

`npm i @microsoft/kiota-abstractions`
