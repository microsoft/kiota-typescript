## Steps to install and run the project

Run the following commands from the root of the project:
- `yarn install` - installs dependencies for all the packages in this repository
- `yarn run build` - compiles all the packages in the project. The typescript `project references` feature is used to transpile the projects in the correct order and allow automatic detection of local changes.
